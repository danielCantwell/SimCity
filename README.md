###What's Working
####SimCity Roles
+ the roles themselves are functioning, they can interact with other roles, send messages and do actions properly.

####SimCity Person Interaction

###How To Run It
1.Keyboard Shortcuts to spawn people
  * CNTL - N : Spawns a bank customer
  * CNTL - M : Spawns a bank Manager
  * CNTL - T : Spawns a bank Teller
  * CNTL - G : Spawns a bank Guard

###What's Missing/left for V2
####SimCity Roles
+ Market.DeliveryPerson
  * Since restaurants and entering buildings was implemented late in the process, the normative scenario for the delivery person was difficult to implement. The interaction is designed, but could use a revision before more work is begun on it. That will probably occur when the restaurants are halfway implemented.

####SimCity Interactions
+ Market/Restaurant
  * The delivery person is key to getting the goods from the market to the restaurant, so this interaction will be implemented when the delivery person is fully implemented.
+ Market/Bank
  * Also, since most of the time was spent getting the customer interactions completed for the city, we didn't have quite enough time to have the market deposit and withdraw funds. However, this should be a quick task and should be implemented soon after the customer interactions are completed.
+ Market Non-norms
  * A lot of the time was spent getting the normative scenarios finished. However, the market was designed with non-normative scenarios in mind, so implementing them will not require extensive overhauling of the code.
